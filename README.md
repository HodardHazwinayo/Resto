+ Ordering Meals (the waiter will have an app and when receiving the order from the client he can help them order, simply show them the digital menu, and first pick the table for them, the chief in return would let the waiter know when food is ready)
+ call/requests the button on table when pressed will create a notification on the waiter's device and be recorded for Analytics
